Secondly, that in favour thereof the then present chief or head magistrate in the kingdom shall respit the execution of the penal laws, by the name of his sharp laws. Thirdly, that about that time the terestial Jerusalem shall be recovered out of the hands of the Turks, the Jews converted, and the fullness of the gentiles brought in, as the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments do declare.

Declaring that the reformation began in Queene Elizabeth&#039;s dayes, is not sufficient for us under greater light. Finishing the work if we now withstand as heretofore, we are to expect, God hath a sad controversie with the land. This faithfull watchman or our English prophet (as he is cald) was persecuted and banished by the bishops, and this commentary condemned by them to the fire; which they could not effect in Queen Elizabeths raigne, till King Iames.

Which practice is contrary to the very nature of mankind (so far as it is drawn out of the corruption and depravation) which would be good and do good, and have good cherished, and evil suppressed, both in it self and others. ... Yet this unhappy error will always be committed in nations and governments, until the proper right and just liberty of men&#039;s consciences be discerned, acknowledged and allowed. Likewise, there are some answers given to that common objection, against affording conscience in its due liberty, because evil persons may pretend conscience to escape the just punishment of their evil deeds. With a brief account of that supposed stubbornes, which by man is objected against the people called Quakers. ... By Isaac Penington the younger.</TITLE>

Yet he with as much malice as impertinency, hath inserted his vindication (as he cals it) into his epistle to the reader, put a sermon of his, lately printed, entituled, Justification justified; wherein, however, he hath justified his doctrine, he hath condemned himself (as in reference to me) in the judgement of all rationall persons.</TITLE>

And the power of the Prince of Darkness called into question; and he himself examin&#039;d by the truth, how he came to raign over mankind; and how long his time shall be, till he comes to be cast out of his dominion, and the creature be deliver&#039;d from under his tyranny; to serve God in spirit and in truth, as Christ, the prince of peace, has order&#039;d them. Also the number of him whom the world hath wonder&#039;d after, found out; and demonstrated to be near at an end: and withal, that it is no wayes unlawful, nor in vain, both to hope, and to expect the utter desolation, and destruction of sin in this life, and the setting up of perfect righteousness in the souls of men, where sin has too long raign&#039;d. Written in a testimony to the truth, and against the false position of the devil, and his servants; by a servant of God, Steven Crisp.</TITLE>
